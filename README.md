# PM01: Site visit

For Project Milestone 01, schedule a site visit with your service learning customer (the community partner you will be working for). The goal of the site visit is to learn more about the organization you will be working with. To truly develop a software application for your customer, you must understand the customer's work, including the people they work with (their customers), the product or service they are producing, and the purpose of the work.
